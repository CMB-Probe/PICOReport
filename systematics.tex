Aside from control of foregrounds, the most compelling reason to observe the CMB from space is the opportunity for excellent control of systematic errors that affect CMB measurements from any platform.  
The L2 environment offers excellent stability as well as the ability to observe large fractions of the sky on many time scales without interference from the Sun, Earth, or Moon.
The redundancy of observations allows the checking of consistency of results and an improved ability to calibrate and to correct systematic errors in post-processing analysis.

As of today, there is a clear path to demonstrate that state-of-the-art technology and data processing can take advantage of the L2 environment and control systematic errors to a level that enables the science goals of PICO. 

A rich literature investigates the types of systematic errors due to the environment, the instrumentation, observation strategies, and data analysis that confound the polarization measurement by creating a bias or an increased variance\cite{hu03,shimon2008,yadav2010}. 
Every measurement to date has  reached a systematic error limit, and have advanced many sophisticated techniques to mitigate systematics, finding both new technological solutions and new analysis techniques.
As an example, the BICEP's systematics limited it to r=0.1\cite{Takahaski2010} while through additional effort within the program, BICEP2 achieved a systematics limit of r=6$\times$10$^{-3}$\cite{BICEP2_III}).
In the near term, the ground based and suborbital CMB community will continue to develop new techniques in handling systematics, particularly in developing the CMB-S4 project.

All prior on-orbit measurements of CMB polarization were limited by systematic errors until an in-depth study of the systematics was performed and the post-processing data analysis suppressed them\cite{Bennett13,planck2016_xlvi,Planck2018_I}. 
Paricularly we note Fig. 3 of the Planck legacy paper which indicates Planck's systematic error limits on the polarization power spectral measurements.
Recently studied space missions, such as EPIC-IM, LiteBird and  \core, have placed
systematic error mitigation at the forefront of the case for their
mission and have developed tools and strategies for estimating and mitigating these\cite{hazumi2012,wallis2017,Natoli2018}.

End-to-end simulation of the experiment is an essential tool,
including realistic instabilities and non-idealities of the spacecraft,
telescope, instrument and folding in data post-processing techniques
used to mitigate the effects.  Systematics are coupled with the
spacecraft scan strategy, and the details of the 
data analysis pipeline.  

\subsubsection{List of Systematics}
The systematic errors faced by PICO can be categorized into three broad categories: 
1) Intensity-to-polarization leakage, 2) stability, and 3)
straylight and are listed in Table \ref{tbl:SystematicsList}.  
These were prioritized for further study using a risk factor assessed by the working group.  
The risk factor incorporates the working group's assessment of how mission-limiting the effect is, how well these effects are understood by the community and whether mitigation techniques exist.  

The working group's three highest risk systematic errors were studied further and are discussed in subsections below.  The PICO team used 
 simulation and analysis tools developed for Planck\cite{plank2015_xii_focalplane} and \core, adapting them for PICO.

We note that many of the systematics could be mitigated further through the use of polarization modulation such as a half-wave plate or a variable phase delay modulator.  
For the purposes of the cost constraints of PICO, we investigated mitigation techniques that do not require a modulator.

\subsubsection{Absolute polarization angle calibration}
\label{sec:angle}

The rotation of the CMB polarization can have different causes,
including 1. a birefringent primordial Universe, or a Faraday rotation
due a primordial magnetic field \citep{Pogosian+2018}, 2. birefringent
foregrounds, or interaction with the Galactic magnetic field,
3. systematic effects in the instrument, and in particular an error on
the actual direction of polarization measured by each detector.  
While the first two sources create a rotation that may depend on scale,
position and/or frequency, the latter depends mainly on
the detector considered. 

A rotation {\prang} of the direction of polarization mixes the $Q$ and $U$ Stokes parameters via
$Q\pm iU \longrightarrow e^{\mp i 2 \prang} (Q\pm iU)$
and thus mixes the the power spectra and their correlations as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:rot_bb_tb_eb}.

In Planck, the ground measurements of the detectors orientation had an error of $\pm 0.9\degree$ (rel.) $\pm 0.3\degree$ (abs.) \citep{Rosset+2010}.

The most recent constraints on cosmological birefringence (or systematic rotation) was set in \citet{Planck2016_XLIX}, looking for residual signal in $TB$ and $EB$ spectra, but are dominated by the uncertainties on the detector orientations.

For \pico, the relative rotation of the detectors, could be measured with a good accuracy (a few $0.1\arcmin$ ?, \EFH{refs?}) on the CMB, but the overall rotation is difficult to determine.
Known polarized sources, such as the Crab Nebula, could be used to do that but \citet{Aumont+2018} show that the current uncertainty of $0.33\degree = 20\arcmin$ on the Crab polarization orientation, obtained when combining all the available measurements, 
would not the measurement of tensorial $B$ modes below $r \sim 0.01$ (assuming everything else to be nominal), far from \pico's target.

%Figures \ref{fig:rot_sens_0} and \ref{fig:rot_sens_2} show how the measurement of $r$ by \pico\ is degraded because of an overall rotation of polarization, and how $TB$ and $EB$ can be used to monitor this rotation, assuming that the only source of polarization rotation is instrumental.
%These results are obtained assuming the spectra to have a Gaussian likelihood, with a variance $\propto 1/\fsky$, and ignoring the foreground contributions.

In the absence of other systematics and foregrounds, an unaccounted polarization rotation $\alpha$ of $10\arcmin$ increases
the error bar of $r$ by 30\%, while $EB$, $TB$ and $BB$ spectra can measure a rotation $\alpha$ at 3$\sigma$ when $\alpha \sim 0.07, 0.2$  and $0.9\arcmin$ respectively
 on perfectly delensed maps, and $0.25, 0.9$ and $4.5\arcmin$ on raw maps.

In principle, the technique of using the $TB$ and $EB$ spectra can detect and measure a global polarization rotation error at levels ($~0.1 \arcmin$) well below those affecting $r$ measurements in $BB$ ($> 1 \arcmin$).  However, a future mission should include additional aspects of the measurements of CMB polarization, such as delensing, the interaction with foregrounds, and $1/f$ noise in simulating and assessing the impact of an angle calibration error.

\subsubsection{Gain Stability}
\label{sec:gain}
Photometric calibration is the process of converting the raw output of the receivers into a physically-meaningful quantity, such as thermodynamic temperature or brightness. As CMB receivers are usually linear, this process reduces to the characterization of the \emph{gain factor} $G$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:gainStability:Response}
y(t) = G(t) \times T\bigl(\vec{x}(t)\bigr) + n(t),
\end{equation}
where $y(t)$ is the timestream of raw samples produced by the detector, $G(t)$ is the gain factor (which we allow to vary with time), $T$ is the sky temperature observed along direction $\vec{x}(t)$ (which varies with time as the spacecraft spins), and $n(t)$ is a noise term that includes both uncorrelated and correlated noise. It is assumed that the timescale of variation in $G$ ($G / \dot{G}$) is much longer than the typical timescale of variations in $T$: in the case of Planck, this was of the order of several days.

In the case of space CMB experiments, the characterization of $G(t)$ is commonly done using the signal caused by the motion of the spacecraft with respect to the rest frame of the CMB itself. This signal is commonly called the \emph{dipole}, as its most significant contribute is at multipole $\ell=1$. For the PICO concept study, we evaluated the impact of noise in the estimation of $G(t)$ using the tools developed for the Planck/LFI instrument and the CORE mission proposal. The quality of the estimate depends on the noise level of the receiverse, but also on the details of the scanning strategy. The Planck/LFI experiment, because of a poor choice of the scanning strategy parameters (namely, a too slow precession motion), was forced to avoid using one year out of four in the 2015 data release [REF]. We can anticipate that this problem is not expected in PICO, thanks to the significantly faster precession envisaged.

In order to test the impact of calibration uncertainties, we have run the following analysis:
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{step:gainStability:perfectObservation} We simulated the observation of the sky, assuming four receivers and the nominal scanning strategy. We included both white noise and $1/f$ noise. The sky only contained CMB anisotropies, plus the CMB dipole.
\item\label{step:gainStability:calibration} We ran the calibration code to fit the dipole against the raw data simulated during step~\ref{step:gainStability:perfectObservation}.
\item\label{step:gainStability:imperfectObservation} We simulated again the observation of the sky, but this time we used the values of $G$ computed during step~\ref{step:gainStability:calibration}, which contain errors due to the presence of $n(t)$ and the CMB signal in Eq.~\eqref{eq:gainStability:Response}. The noise in the output map is therefore the sum of the noise in the error on $G$ and the term $n$.
\end{enumerate}
The presence of foregrounds in the sky signal would cause a bias in the estimation of the calibration constants, due to the presence of large scale features in the Milky Way at microwave frequencies. A full data analysis pipeline for PICO should pair the calibration step with the component separation step, following a schema similar to what has been done by the Planck/LFI team for the 2018 data release [CITATION]: the application of the calibration code should be followed by a component separation analysis, and these two steps should be iterated until the result converge to a solution. In this analysis we assume to study the calibration at the last iteration, when the components have already been properly separated.

Results of the simulation are shown in Figures~XXX and YYY. The scanning strategy employed by PICO allows for a much better calibration than in the case of Planck's, thanks to the much faster precession.

\subsubsection{Far Sidelobe Pickup}
\label{sec:fsl}
The main beam (within a few degrees of the axis of beam response) in a CMB mission can be measured to high precision using the planets as compact sources.  Measurement of each detector's response to signals more than a few degrees off axis, which tends to be at a very low level (more than --80dB less than the peak response) but spread over a very large solid angle, is difficult to do pre-launch, and may not be done accurately after launch.  Nonetheless, this far sidelobe can couple bright Galactic signal from many tens of degrees off-axis and confuse it with polarized signal from the CMB off the Galactic plane.  

To evaluate this systematic error, GRASP software\footnote{https://www.ticra.com} was used to compute the \pico\ telescope's pickup over the full sky.  This full-sky beam was convolved with a polarized Galactic signal and a full \pico\ mission scan using the simulation pipeline.  The far sidelibe pickup was estimated to contribute less than XXX to the B-mode angular power spectrum and thus an error in $r$ of YYY.

In a real mission due to the difficulties of measuring this beam, physical optics simulation capabilities must be maintained and validated as well as possible with on-orbit data.

\subsubsection{Key Findings}
Properly modeling, engineering for, and controlling the effects of systematic errors in a
next-generation CMB probe is critical.  In particular we note:
\begin{itemize}
\item The raw sensitivity of the instrument should include enough margin
that data subsets can independently achieve the science goals.
This allows testing of the results in the data analysis and additional
data cuts, if needed.

\item NASA's support of ground-based and suborbital CMB missions will mitigate risk to a future space mission as PICO by continuing to develop analysis techniques and technology for mitigation of systematic errors.

\item In a PICO mission's phase A, a complete end-to-end system-level
simulation software facility would be developed to assist the team in setting 
requirements and conducting trades between subsystem requirements while
realistically accounting for post-processing mitigation.  Any future
CMB mission is likely to have similar orbit  
and scan characteristics to those of PICO, thus there is an opportunity for NASA and
the CMB community to invest in further development of this capability now.
