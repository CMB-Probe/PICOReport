A CMB mission aiming for the unprescedented sensitivity of PICO must control
systematic errors to avoid bias or an increased variance of the
science measurement.   
Systematics must be controlled or corrected to a level that enables the PICO
science goals.
Mitigation of systematic errors is the most important reason (along with the broad
wavelength band) to perform a measurement of the CMB polarization from a space telescope,.
Compared with a ground-based, sub-orbital, or even a space mission in
low-Earth orbit, the L2 environment offers excellent stability as well
as the ability to observe large fractions of the sky on many time
scales without interference from the Sun, Earth, or Moon.
This redundancy of observations allows the checking of consisitency of
results and an improved ability to correct systematic errors in
post-processing analysis.

During the course of the PICO Study, a systematics working group
examined systematic errors affecting PICO,
Most  systematic errors can be mitigated by careful design and engineering of 
the spacecraft and instrument, and the use of present-day state-of-the-art
technology and data analysis tools.   
However, some systematic errors may
limit the precision of the B-mode measurement and the group studied
these in further detail. 
The work was based on the experience of the group's involvement with
past missions, in particular Planck, and in recent detailed studies on
the CORE and LiteBird  concepts

End-to-end simulation of the experiment is an essential tool,
including realistic instabilities and non-idealities of the spacecraft,
telescope, instrument and folding in data post-processing techniques
used to mitigate the effects.  During the study, the PICO team used 
 simulation and analysis tools developed for the Planck mission\cite{plank2015_xii_focalplane} and 
the CORE mission concept, adapting them for PICO.  These tools allowed
a deeper examination of several key systematic errors. 

\subsubsection{List of Systematics}
The systematic errors face by PICO can be categorized into three broad categories 
1) Intensity-to-polarization leakage, 2) stability, and 3)
straylight.    These were prioritized for further study based on how

\subsubsection{Key Findings}
Understanding and controlling the effects of systematic errors in a
next-generation CMB probe is critical.

The raw sensitivity of the instrument should include enough margin
that data subsets can independently archieve the science goals.
This allows testing of the results in the data analysis and additional
data cuts, if needed.

In a PICO mission's phase A, a complete end-to-end system-level
simulation facility would be developed to assist the team to set
requirements and conduct trades between subsystem requirements while
realistically accounting for post-processing mitigation.  Any future
CMB mission is likely to have similar orbit  
and scan characteristics to those of PICO, and there is an opportunity for NASA and
the CMB community to begin to develop this capability now.
