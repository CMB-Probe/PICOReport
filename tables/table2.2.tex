\caption{\captiontext
Enumeration of potential systematic errors anticipated in \pico's measurements together with their assessed risk level,
%for affecting measurement of the inflationary signal, 
their effect on the measurements, and in few cases subsections with further discussion. The symbol $T \rightarrow P $ denotes coupling of the intensity (labeled as $T$ to denote temperature) signal into polarization, which would generally be both $E$ and $B$. Similar meaning holds for $E \rightarrow B$. Risk level rises with value. Effects with risk level 5 have been analyzed in more detail.
%Level 5 indicates a highly significant, design-driving effect; it may have limited past measurements, and/or isn't well understood.  Level 4 indicates an effect that is either known to be large but is understood reasonably well, or a smaller effect that requires precise modeling.  Level 3 indicates that we expect the effect to be small, but it is not sufficiently well understood and detailed modeling will be done during Phase~A study. We used simulations to investigate effects with risk level 5.
