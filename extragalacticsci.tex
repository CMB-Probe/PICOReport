{\bf Physics of Reionization}

The reionization of the Universe imprints multiple signals in the CMB, in both temperature and polarization.  In polarization, the most important reionization signal is the large-scale $E$-mode power sourced by the scattering of the temperature quadrupole during this epoch.  This signal allows a direct measurement of the optical depth, $tau$, with very little degeneracy with other parameters (and, to some extent, a measurement of the reionization history itself).  In contrast, inference of $\tau$ from the $TT$ power spectrum is hindered by its direct degeneracy with the scalar fluctuation amplitude.  Thus, large-scale $EE$ power spectrum measurements are a unique and crucial observable to constrain this parameter.  If measurements of $\tau$ are not improved beyond the current uncertainties from {\em Planck}, inference of several new aspects of cosmological physics (e.g., neutrino mass) will be severely hindered.  PICO is the ideal experiment to make this measurement.  Its noise level and frequency coverage permit a cosmic-variance-limited constraint on $\tau$, i.e., $\sigma(\tau) \approx 0.002$.  \textbf{Does this projected error bar need to be derived from the foreground simulations that are being used for $r$ forecasting?  Or is it obvious that if we can reach the $\sigma(r)$ target, this $\sigma(\tau)$ value can easily be achieved?}

In temperature, the most important small-scale imprint is that sourced by the ``patchy'' kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect, due to the peculiar velocities of free electron bubbles around ionizing sources (e.g., galaxies or quasars).  The total kSZ power spectrum receives contributions from both the patchy reionization signal and ``late-time'' sources, e.g., the intergalactic and intracluster media.  The reionization and late-time signals are expected to have comparable amplitudes~\citep{Shaw2012,MMS2012,Battaglia2013}.  With constraints on the late-time contribution from other information (e.g., cross-correlations), effective small-scale foreground removal, and with the primary CMB $TT$ power spectrum constrained by inference from the $EE$ power spectrum, it is possible to extract reionization constraints from the small-scale kSZ power spectrum~\citep{calabrese/etal/2014}.

In addition to these signals, reionization also leaves specific non-Gaussian signatures in the CMB.  In particular, patchy reionization induces non-trivial 4-point functions in both temperature~\citep{SmithFerraro2017} and polarization~\citep{DvorkinSmith2008}.  The temperature 4-point function can be used to separate reionization and late-time kSZ contributions.  Combinations of temperature and polarization data can be used to build quadratic estimators for reconstruction of the patchy $\tau$ field, analogous to CMB lensing reconstruction.  \textbf{Are we planning to try to forecast these here?}

\textbf{FIGURE: $\tau$ constraint, kSZ power spectrum constraints, perhaps patchy $\tau$ reconstruction constraints? I assume the four-point estimator does not look promising given the relatively low resolution of PICO, but we can check the Smith papers.  This will essentially be an analog of Fig. 39 of the SO forecasting paper (Nick and Marcelo have the relevant code).}


The Sections below need to be rearranged to match other Science Objective(s) from the STM, but to also relay the 
breadth of science reachable by PICO, even if those goals are not in the STM. 

{\bf Structure Formation via Gravitational Lensing}


Measurements of the CMB reveal structure imprinted not only at the early time of recombination, but also at nearly every significant ensuing epoch in cosmic history.  In particular the matter between us and the CMB last-scattering surface will deflect the path of CMB photons, a process known as gravitational lensing.  Although the lensing of the CMB is a weak signal, targeted statistical estimators enable its  extraction.  
The detection of the lensing signal has rapidly progressed, from the first detections in 2007-8 \citep{2007PhRvD..76d3510S, 2008PhRvD..78d3520H} to the recent $ 40\sigma$ measurement by the {\it Planck} team \cite{2018arXiv180706210P}.  When applied to a rich dataset such as that expected from the PICO satellite, these estimators will provide a map of all the matter in the Universe in projection, with the most sensitivity at redshift $z \simeq 2$ and down to scales of approximately ten arcminutes.  

Forecasts show that the power spectrum of lensing in this map can be detected at approximately 580$\sigma$ or 650$\sigma$ for the requirement or CBE configurations, respectively.  Such high signal to noise measurements represent an order of magnitude improvement over the current state of the art, obtained by the  {\it Planck} team.  Figure \ref{fig:lensingNoisePICO} shows noise curves from the reconstruction of CMB lensing.

\caption{\label{fig:lensingNoisePICO} Lensing noise curves for various experimental configuraitons, showing the noise per mode of the reconstructed lensing field.  The  signal curve, the CMB lensing power spectrum is shown in grey; mapping of dark matter is possible at modes  where the noise curves fall below this signal.  Shown in solid are the performance of the $EB$ polarization estimator, including iterated delensing; this estimator performs best on large angular scales.  On smaller angular scales the temperature ($TT$) estimator shows the best performance. The associated signal to noise ratio for the lensing power spectrum is 570 for the 'requirement' configuration and 650 for the 'CBE'  configuration.}

Lensing breaks the highly symmetric configuration of  primordial density fluctuations appearing as $E$ modes on the sky, turning some of these into $B$ modes.  If not accounted for, this effect yields an  noise floor on the large-scale $B$ modes that can be measured from the early Universe.  However, maps of $E$ modes and of the lensing field, both of which will be obtained with PICO data, can be used together to create a template for these lensed $B$ modes.  This template can then be subtracted from the measured $B$ modes to obtain improved performance, in a process known as ``delensing'' \citep{2004PhRvD..69d3005S,2012JCAP...06..014S}.  Forecasts show that up to 80\% of the lens-induced $B$ mode power can be removed in the 'requirement' configuration, with this number becoming 85\% for the current best estimate.
