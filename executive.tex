Recent theoretical developments and measurements of the \ac{CMB} have uncovered tremendous potential for new discoveries over the next 10-20 years. The new discoveries are promising to be no less revolutionary then those attained to date. 

The potential new discoveries are based on deeper measurements of the spatial pattern of the CMB's polarization\comor{would like to make this broader to not shortchange T-science, but still connect to $E$, $B$ in the next paragraph}.

\comor{broad science, unique mission, nothing better in the foreseable future, complementing and enriching other science in the next decade, comparatively cheap, within cost, using existing technologies, relying on extensive community experience both on the ground and in space}

PICO's data will enrich and complement other astrophysical surveys in the next decade.
