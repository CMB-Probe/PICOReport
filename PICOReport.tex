\section{Executive Summary (2 pg, Hanany)} 
\subfile{executive.tex}

\section{Science (30.5 pages)}

    \subsection{Introduction (1 pg, Hanany)}
     NASA suggested table of contents says Science Intro or Landscape section should include:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item State of the Art in the Field
        \item Compelling Outstanding Questions
        \item Needed Capabilities for Progress
        \end{itemize}

      \subfile{landscape.tex}

\subsection{Science Objectives (17.5 pgs) } 

  The PICO Science Traceability Matrix (2pg, Hanany\&Trangsrud) will be inserted around here.  It is an 11x17 foldout, so it counts as 2 pages, which leaves 16 to all the rest in 2.2. 
    
    \vspace{12pt}
     FOR EACH OF THE BELOW SUBSECTIONS:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Introduce and elaborate on the applicable PICO ``Science Objectives" from the STM table (what do they mean and why are they important)
    \item Observations/Measurements that enable PICO to accomplish each Science Objective (tell the data analysis story that connects the Observations column of the STM to the Science Objective column)
    \item Contextualize relative to sub-orbital and other space missions
    \item Science yield estimate (be quantitative. how well will PICO do at Baseline/Required performance? at Current Best Estimate performance?)
    \item Include a summary plot or table which demonstrates PICO's performance against the Science Objective as written (e.g. how it discriminates between different theories) 
    \item Perceived science impact (be qualitative. this isn't about reducing the sigma on a parameter.  this is about what we will learn about nature)
    \end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Fundamental Physics (6 pgs, Flauger, Green)}

To include: Cosmic Inflation, Particle Physics (Neutrinos and Light Relics)

        Should address these Science Objectives from the STM:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item ``Probe the physics of the big bang by detecting the energy scale at which inflation occurred if it is above $4\times10^{15}$ GeV, or place an upper limit if it is below" [$r$]
        \item ``Probe the physics of the big bang by excluding classes of potentials as the driving force of inflation" [$n_s$, $n_{run}$]
        \item ``Determine the sum of neutrino masses, and distinguish between inverted and normal neutrino mass hierarchies" [$\Sigma m_{\nu}$]
        \item ``Detect departures from or tightly constrain the thermal history of the universe" [$N_{eff}$]
        \item Origin of magnetic fields and cosmic birefringence
        \end{itemize} 

\subsubsection{Cosmic Structure Formation and Evolution (4 pgs. Battaglia \& Alvarez)}

Should address these Science Objectives from the STM that relate to reionization + ??

\subsubsection{Galactic Structure and Star Formation (5 pgs, Chuss \& Fissel)}

Should address these Science Objectives from the STM:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item ``Determine whether the interstellar medium of our galaxy is unique by comparing the ratio of energy in magnetic field to turbulence to that in nearby galaxies."
        \item ``Determine if magnetic fields are the dominant cause of low star formation efficiency in our Galaxy."
        \item ``Determine whether radiative torque is responsible for the alignment of dust grains with magnetic fields"
        \item ``Determine the influence of the magnetic field on Galactic dynamics within the Milky Way."
        \end{itemize}

\subsection{Measurement Requirements (2 pgs, Hanany \& Trangsrud)}

Some requirements derive from the science ($\tau$ = full sky)
Some requirements derive from foregrounds (frequency coverage) and some from systematics (particular scan pattern)

\subsection{Additional Science (2 pgs, de Zotti)} 

Describe science that we get for free. 

\subsection{Complementarity with other Measurements and Surveys (1 pg)} 

Should describe complementarity with sub-orbital CMB measurements and with other surveys, 
both in space and on the ground.  This is summary text (more detail in subsections about specific objectives)


\subsection{Foregrounds (4 pgs)}
\subfile{foregrounds.tex}

\subsection{Systematic Errors (3 pgs, Crill)}
\subfile{systematics.tex}

\section{Instrument (6 pgs, Trangsrud \& Hanany)}
\subfile{instrument.tex}

\section{Mission (3 pgs, Trangsrud)}
\subfile{mission.tex}

\section{Technology Maturation (4 pgs, O'Brient \& Trangsrud)}
\subfile{technology.tex}

For each technology include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Requirements
\item Planned activities
\item Schedule and Milestones
\item Estimated Cost
\end{itemize}
